# Lights Out

Lights out is a game/ puzzle that was created back in 1995 by Tiger Electronics. Normally, it consists of a 5x5 grid of lights where your goal is to turn them all on/ off.
Many games have utilised this concept and implimented it as a puzzle that must be solved.

The main purpose of this repo, is creating a brute force solver of the puzzle, which I created several versions of, each one faster than the previous iteration.
Also, instead of simply sticking to Javascript like I normally do, I decided to branch out and start using C++. The C++ version is significantly faster than the JS ones.

I also created a terminal application that will solve to solve 3x3, 4x4 and 5x5 states. This again, is written in C++ and can be found in the `terminal (v3)` folder.
The code compiled into an .exe can be found in the `releases` section of this repo.
